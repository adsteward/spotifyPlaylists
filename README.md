# spotifyPlaylists
A few Python scripts to do boring spotify functions.

Most of these functions are pretty specific to the way I organize/use spotify but other (like allMusic) are more applicable to more people.

Note: all my personal playlist ids/tokens/user id are stored in a separate ignored file so any users would have to add in their own ids/tokens/etc. in a few places.

## Usage/Contents
- all_music.py
  - To make playlists with either all of the user's saved tracks and tracks from saved albums
  - AND/OR make playlists with every song the user has in a playlist somewhere
- to_listen_to.py
  - Updates a playlist with songs from three other playlists
  - (envisioned as a way to compile songs from playlists spotify makes that update weekly (eg discover weekly, new music friday, etc.)
- weekly.py
  - Makes a new playlist with songs liked/saved in the past 2 weeks that are NOT on "last week's" playlist
  - (envisioned as a way to create a weekly playlist every week)
- helper_functions.py
  - Various functions used across the scripts/files
