# spotifyPlaylists
A few Python scripts to do boring spotify functions.

Most of these functions are pretty specific to the way I organize/use spotify but other (like allMusic) are more applicable to more people.

Note: all my personal playlist ids/tokens/user id are stored in a separate ignored file so any users would have to add in their own ids/tokens/etc. in a few places.
